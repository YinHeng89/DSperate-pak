# The adapter's three files are new files in patch 0005, so they are taken
# straight out of the locked patch and compiled with the host C++ compiler --
# the same bytes the MLP1 build compiles, with no upstream checkout, Docker or
# device. Then:
#
#   1. the shared leaf-contracts fixtures, at the commit and sha256 pinned in
#      tests/ra-account/contract.lock.json, replayed through the emulator's own
#      classifier;
#   2. the marker and transition table (state_test.cpp);
#   3. the bridge itself (bridge_test.cpp): explicit "achievements off",
#      interrupted token and marker writes at every boundary, low storage,
#      corruption, a missing managed directory, pop-up notices, and an
#      unmanaged sign-in that persists nothing;
#   4. source checks on the patch for what a host test cannot run: the
#      frontend decides "achievements off" before import(), and nothing in the
#      adapter persists an unmanaged sign-in.
